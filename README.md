# Minecraft - Card Game?
A recreation of "Minecraft - Card Game?" with quality-of-life improvements
## What purpose does this repository serve?
"Minecraft - Card Game?" was a card game manufactured by Mattel and lisenced by Mojang. It was originally released on store shelves in 2015, and is now discontinued.
This repository redoes the card game using the new Minecraft textures and features, as if it were updated by Mattel themselves. It will in the future provide printables for others to make cards of their own.
## When will I be able to own a copy?
The cards are still unfinished and will need time and patience to complete, especially because of other on-going projects. They are aimed to be finished before February 2024, and will be available for download in the "Releases" section.
